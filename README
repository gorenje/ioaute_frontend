== Welcome to Ioaute

Ioaute is an open social publishing platform and this is its frontend.

The frontend can be found at https://github.com/gorenje/ioaute_backend

An example can be found at http://pubme.2monki.es/

== Motivation

To provide an open social publishing platform for everyone. Ioaute aims to provide 
a mix of Wiki, GitHub and community: editing content on online like Wiki, clone
and improve content like GitHub and community by using content from everywhere on 
the web.

Unlike a Wiki, only the author is allowed to edit existing content but anyone can
copy and extend that content, a-la GitHub. And since the world is a community, features
for adding content from anyone are built right in.

== Technical

Cappuccino is used to build the frontend. This repo used to be compiled on the server 
during a deploy of the backend, however this is no longer the case and instead, the
frontend is compiled locally and the result is copied across to the backend before
being deployed.
