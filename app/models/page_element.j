/*
 * A PageElement. What does it do? It's responsible for communicating with the server
 * and inform it that something changed with a specific subclass. This means that a 
 * PageElement is a general representation of a specific (e.g. Image, Facebook Image, etc)
 * object contained in a document. This generalisation means that the subclass don't need
 * communicate directly with the server and don't need to send over their position nor size
 * to the server.
 *
 * How does an PageElement come to life? There are three creational events in the life of
 * a PageElement:
 *
 *  1. It's created as part of a drag operation from an external source. Example: facebook.j
 *     Here the PageElement is initialized via a json object that came from the external
 *     service and contains all the necessary data to initialize the object. The object
 *     can initialize instance variables that are sent to the server automagically (see
 *     flickr.j for an example).
 *  2. As part of the drop operation(*) a PageElement is retrieved from the DragDropManager
 *     and is cloned via cloneForDrop. This fairly simple operation and subclasses don't
 *     need to do anything special.
 *  3. Editing an existing publication requires that PageElements are initialized via
 *     json sent from the backend server. This is done by sending (for elements that come
 *     from external sources) to construct (on the server side) a json object that looks 
 *     just the same as the one used to initialize the object from the external source.
 *     For tool elements, i.e. things that we create ourself, we use the format that we
 *     have stored on the server. 
 *
 * *=Drag&Drop's are managed over the DragDropManager, hence there is a "drag" operation
 *   and a drop operation. See drag_drop_manager.j for details.
